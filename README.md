This is a project that can read in a binary file, turn it into a picture and turn it into a video, then decode it and restore the binary information after it is transmitted by a mobile phone
The main technical：
1.Binary streams are encoded into images
2.Generate and identify registration points
3.Image to video (FFMPEG)
4.Video turns into images（OpenCV）
5.The image pixels are read and converted into a binary stream
6.Binary stream restore information
The above is the general process of this project, to achieve a simple transmission of information through visible light function
